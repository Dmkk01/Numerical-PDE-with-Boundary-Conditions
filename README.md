# Numerical PDE with Boundary Conditions
This repository is part of my Bachelor Thesis at Aalto University.

## An Analysis of Boundary Conditions in Partial Differential Equations using Finite Difference Method
The purpose of the thesis is to analyze the effects of boundary conditions on common partial
differential equations (in two-dimensional space), namely the heat equation and wave equation.
This thesis will focus on solving these equations numerically using the finite difference
method. The computations will be performed using Matlab, since it allows for simple matrix
calculations and provides useful visualization features.
